This is Crescent/Skipper </a> <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/Cathode" target="_blank" alt="Zhihu" title="Zhihu"> <img src="./icons8-zhihu-512.png" width="32px"/> </a>, a PhD student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (**BUPT**).

My current research interests include interpretable distributed intelligence and its application in mobile communication.

I'm trying to document different types of projects using GitHub repositories.
